    <h3>Compiling a program</h3>
    <p>IlEditor will compile most ILE types by default. To compile a program</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the Compile dropdown when the member is open, or</li>
        <li>Right click on a member in the member listing and use one of the available Compile options</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The default compile can be changed in the Compile Settings tool window (more below).</p>
    <p>You can use the Ctrl+Shift+C shortcut to submit the default compile. If the compile command has "*EVENTF" within it, it will load the error listing for you automatically after it has tried to compile.</p>

    <h3>Changing the compile commands</h3>
    <p>Each command is set out into the type groups, which have specific commands - for example, the RPGLE type might have CRTBNDRPG and also CRTRPGMOD. The default command might be CRTBNDRPG.</p>
    <p>To change the default compile, create new compile commands or change existing commands, you need to open up the Compile Settings in the Toolbox window.</p>
    <p>Each type gets their own default compile. To change the default compile, right click on a compile command and 'Set Default for Type'. This means, whenever you use the Compile option (Ctrl+Shift+C) it will use this command to compile.</p>
